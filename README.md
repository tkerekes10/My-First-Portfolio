My-First-Portfolio
This is my first starter portfolio

Description
This is my first starter portfolio. I created this using HTML and CSS elements. This was my first time using bootstrap to help with the styling. I am not very creative, so this was a good exercise in stepping outside of my comfort zone in order to create something new from scratch!

Included in this portfolio are some pictures of my wife and pets, as well as links to my pre-work projects. This was a good lesson in styling pages and I know that I will add to this once I have some more work to show off as well as adding some additional features!

Credits
I have to thank my wife for the flavicon/logo that can be seen on the portfolio logo ![Logo](./assets/images/TDK.png)
