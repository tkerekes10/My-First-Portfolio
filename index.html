            I am originally from Northern California, but I reside and work in Atlanta, Georgia. I am happily married and have two of the sweetest animals in the world! I currently work for a Pharmacy Software Company called Brightree in our support department. I am the Senior Technical Support Rep for my team specializing in our Pharmacy/Infusion module. Since this is a newer module, much of my day-to-day consists of identifying and solving complex problems in order to relay simple solutions to our customers.
            I was drawn to the pharmacy industry when I went to the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs!!!). UGA had a fast-tracked program where you could finish your undergrad and Pharm.D in 6 years instead of the regular 8. Once I started working in a retail pharmacy as a tech, I quickly realized that this was not the right choice for me. So, here I am with all this pharmacy experience and knowledge, but without a career path. This led me to opening a new door into technical support, where each day I get to use my problem-solving skills with new errors and issues.
            My scientific background taught me all the problem solving and logic that is needed to be a good web developer.  From going into each problem with a plan to noting successful and unsuccessful tests, these are skills that meld into daily life outside of the bench in UGAâ€™s chemistry labs.
            My main interest in web development and computer science in general is learning a new skill that I can use to better myself and the world around me.

                <p>This was my first attempt at creating an HTML/CSS page. I worked on the basics of both languages while incorporating some links as well as images. This is still a work in progress as I will continue to add to the webpage as I learn new languages and tools in order to make this how I imagined it.
